# Beyond Feelings

 # The Context

This first section explores seven important concepts-individuality, critical thinking, truth, knowledge, opinion, evidence, and argument.

## C1 Who Are You

### The Influence of Time and Place

To sum up, living in a difference age or culture would make you a different person. Even if you rebelled against the values of your time and place, they still would represent the context of your life---in other words, they still would influence your responses.

### The Influence of Ideas

If you believe in yourself, you can succeed at anything. From this if follows that nothing else but belief---neither talent nor hard work---is necessary for success. The reason the two ideas are equivalent is that their meanings are inseparably linked.

### The Influence of Mass Culture

Television programmers use frequent scene shifts and sensory appeals such as car crashes, violence, and sexual encounters to keep audience interest from diminishing.

Manipulation has prevented many people from developing a mature attention span. They expect the classroom and the workplace to provide the same constant excitement they get from television. That, of course, is an impossible demand, and when it isn't met they call their teachers boring and their work unfulfilling. Because such people seldom have the patience to read books that require them to think, many publishers have replaced serious books with light fare written by celebrities.

Even when writers of serious books do manage to become published authors, they are often directed to give short, dramatic answers during promotional interviews, sometimes at the expense of accuracy.

### The "Science of Manipulation"

The most effective appeal to consumers was not to the mind but to the emotions.

Research has shown that human memory can be manipulated. The way a question is asked can change the details in a person's memory and even make a person remember something that never happened.

Advertisers and people with political or social agendas are not content to stimulate emotions and/or plant ideas in our minds. They also seek to reinforce those impressions by repeating them again and again. The more people hear a slogan or talking point, the more familiar it becomes.

Frankl argues that one human need is higher than self-actualization: self-transcendence, the need to rise above narrow absorption with self. According to Frankl, "the primordial anthropological fact is that being human is being always directed, and pointing to something or someone other than oneself: to a meaning to fulfill or another human being to encounter, a cause to serve or a person to love."

### Becoming an Individual

We are born with but rather as something acquired-or, more precisely, earned. Individuality begins in the realization that is it impossible to escape being influenced by other people and by circumstance. The essence of individuality is vigilance. Some guidelines achieve this:

- 1. Treat your first reaction to any person, issue, or situation as tentative.
  2. Decide why you reacted as you did.
  3. Think of other possible reactions you might have had to the person, issue, or situation.
  4. Ask yourself whether one of the other reactions is more appropriate than your first reaction.

## C2 What Is Critical Thinking?

Whereas the brain is a physical entity composed of matter and therefore subject to decay, the mind is a metaphysical entity.

"History is, fundamentally, the adventure of human consciousness" and "the fundamental history of humankind is the history of mind"

### Critical Thinking Defined

Feeling is a subject response that reflects emotion, sentiment, or desire; it generally occurs spontaneously rather than through a conscious mental act. The feelings arise automatically.

In contrast to feeling, thinking is a conscious mental process performed to solve a problem, make a decision, or gain understanding. Whereas feeling has no purpose beyond expressing itself, thinking aims beyond itself to knowledge or action.

There are three broad categories of thinking: reflective, creative, and critical. The focus of this book is on critical thinking. The essence of critical thinking is evaluation. Critical thinking, therefore, may be defined as the process by which we test claims and arguments and determine which have merit and which do not. In other words, critical thinking is a search for answers, a quest.

### Characteristics of Critical Thinkers

Critical thinking means making sound decisions, regardless of how common or uncommon those decisions are.

Basic Activities in Critical Thinking

The basic activities in critical thinking are investigation, interpretation, and judgement, in that order.

As we noted previously, irresponsible thinkers first choose their conclusions and then seek out evidence to justify their choices. They fail to realize that the only conclusion worth drawing is one based on a thorough understanding of the problem or issue and its possible solutions or resolutions.

### Critical Thinking and Writing

Writing may be used for either of two broad purposes: to discover ideas or to communicate them. But the former can be very helpful, not only in sorting out ideas you've already produced, but also in stimulating the flow of new ideas. For some reason, the very act of writing down one idea seems to generate additional ideas.

Whenever you write to discover ideas, focus on the issue you are examining and record all your thoughts, questions, and assertions. Don't worry about organization or correctness. If ideas come slowly, be  patient. If they come suddenly, in a rush, don't try to slow down the process and develop any one of them; simply jot them all down.(There will be time for elaboration and correction later.) Direct your mind's effort, but be sensitive to ideas on the fringe of consciousness. Often they, too, will prove valuable.

### Critical Thinking and Discussion

At its best, discussion deepens understanding and promotes problem solving and decision making.

Guidelines:

1.  Whenever possible, prepare in advance.
2. Set reasonable expectations.
3. Leave egotism and personal agendas at the door. To be productive, discussion requires an atmosphere of mutual respect and civility.
4. Contribute but don't dominate. 
5. Avoid distracting speech mannerisms.
6. Listen actively. The best way to maintain your attention is to be alert for such distractions and to resist them. Strive to enter the speaker's frame of mind, understand what is said, and connect it with what was said previously. Whenever you realize your mind is wandering, drag it back to the task.
7. Judge ideas responsibly.
8. Resisting the urge to shout or interrupt.

### Avoiding Plagiarism

The only real difference is that intellectual property is purchased with mental effort rather than money.

the process to avoid plagiarism.

Step1: When you are researching a topic, keep your sources' ideas separate from your own. Begin by keeping a record of each source of information you consult.

Step2: As you read each source, note the ideas you want to refer to in your writing.

Step3: When you compose your paper, work borrowed ideas and words into your own writing by judicious use of quoting and paraphrasing. In addition, give credit to the various authors.

### A Difference of Opinion

If, as is more likely, you find that one view is more insightful than the others but that they all make some valid points, construct a view of your own that combines the insights from all views and explain why that view is the most reasonable of all.

## C3 What Is Truth

Those who accepted the existence of this Truth believed it was a spiritual reality, not a physical one. That is, it was not a celestial ledger or file drawer--yet it was beyond time and space.

### Where Does It All Begin

You have heard the old saying <i>Seeing is believing</i>. The reverse---<i>Believing is seeing</i> --- is equally correct. To a greater or lesser extent, what we regard as our unique perspective bears the imprint of other people's ideas and beliefs.

### Imperfect Perception

Perception may be intermingled with interpretation---the expectation that an event will unfold in a certain way may color our perception of the way the event actually unfolds.

### Imperfect Memory

### Even the Wisest Can Err

### Truth Is Discovered, Not Created

Let's review what our evaluation has revealed. First, our ideas and beliefs are unavoidably influenced by other people's, particularly in childhood. Second, perception and memory are imperfect. Third, our information can be inaccurate or incomplete.

We do create something, all right, but it is not truth. It is beliefs, ideas that we accept as true but that could easily be false.

Truth is apprehended by discovery, a process that favors the curious and the diligent.

Each side is entitled to its own truth. If anyone had, he or she would have been attacked by both camps for talking nonsense and trivializing an important issue.

"I know I have limitations and can easily be mistaken. And surely I'll never find all the answers I'd like to. But I can observe a little more accurately, weigh things a little more thoroughly, and make up my mind a little more carefully. If I do so, I'll be a little closer to the truth."

### Understanding Cause and Effect

1. One event can precede another without causing it. The problem with believing that preceding events necessarily cause subsequent events is that such thinking overlooks the possibility of coincidence. This possibility is the basis of the principle that "correlation does not prove causation."
2. Not all causation involves force or necessity. That type of causation is valid, but it would be a mistake to think of it as the only type. Causation also occurs in the nonmaterial realities we call human affairs---more specifically, in the processes of emotion and thought. That type of causation has little, if anything, to do with scientific principles or laws, is almost never inevitable, and is often difficult to predict. If we are to avoid oversimplification, we need to define causation in a way that covers both the scientific realm and the realm of human affairs.
3. There is a wild card in human affairs---free will. Free will is itself a causative factor, and one that can trump all others. It has been rightly said that people can seldom choose the circumstances life places them in, but they can always choose their responses to those circumstance because they possess free will.
4. Causation is often complex.

Cautions will help you avoid oversimplification in analyses:

1. Remember that events seldom, if ever, "just happen."
2. Remember that free will is a powerful causative factor in human affairs, and it is often intertwined with other causes.
3. Be aware that in a chain of events, an effect often becomes a cause.
4. Be aware that, in dealing with human affairs, outcomes can be unpredictable.

## C4 What Does It Mean to Know

### Requirements of Knowing

Knowing involves more than having the right answer. It also involves the realization that you have it.

Knowing usually implies something else, too---the ability to express what is known and how we came to know it.

### How We Come to Know

We can achieve knowledge either actively or passively. We achieve it actively by direct experience, by testing and proving an idea(as in a scientific experiment), or by reasoning. When we do it by reasoning, we analyze a problem, consider all the facts and possible interpretations, and draw the logical conclusion.

We achieve knowledge passively by being told something by someone else. Conditioned as we are to passive learning, it's not surprising that we depend on it in our everyday communication with friends and co-workers. Unfortunately, passive learning has a serious defect. It makes us tend to accept uncritically what we are told even when what we are told is little more than hearsay and rumor.

"A statement of opinion by one writer maybe re-stated as a fact by another, who may in turn be quoted as an authority by yet another; and this process may continue indefinitely, unless it occurs to someone to question the facts on which the original writer based his opinion or to challenge the interpretation he placed upon those facts."

### Why Knowing Is Difficult

One reason why knowing is difficult is that some long unanswered questions continue to resist solution, questions like What cause cancer?

Another reason is that everyday situations arise for which there are no precedents.

Still another reason why knowing is difficult is that, as one generation succeeds another, knowledge is often forgotten or unwisely rejected.

Knowledge is often thought of as dead matter stored on dusty shelves in dull libraries. Unfortunately, the hushed atmosphere of a library can suggest a funeral chapel or a cemetery. But the appearance is deceiving. The ideas on those shelves are very much alive---and often fighting furiously with one another.

### Is Faith a Form of Knowledge?

The term <i>religious faith</i> by definition suggests belief in something that cannot be proved. This is not to say that what is believed is not true, but only that <i>its  truth cannot be demonstrated conclusively.</i> 

### Obstacles to Knowledge

The main negative effect of unrecognized assumptions is that they stifle the curiosity that leads to knowledge.

<i>Guessing</i>  is offering a judgment on a hunch or taking a chance on an answer without any confidence that it is correct.

Because assuming stifles curiosity and guessing denies the importance of evidence, neither is likely to lead to knowledge. The most reliable approach is to be cautious in asserting that you know something. Be conservative in your level of assertion---whenever you are less than certain, speak about possibilities and probabilities.

It means only that you should value firm, bold statements so much that you reserve them for occasions when the evidence permits. Similarly, you should value convictions so highly that you embrace them only when you have sufficient knowledge to do so and that you modify them whenever intellectual honesty requires.

## C5 How Good Are Your Opinions?

In the context of critical thinking, the term <i>opinion</i> refers to expressions of judgment rather than to expressions of taste.

### Opinions Can Be Mistaken

Free societies are based on the wise observation that people have an inalienable right to think their own thoughts and make their own choices.

Critical thinking serves to separate the more worthy form the less worthy and, ultimately, to identify the best.

### Opinions on Moral Issues

The most important criteria are obligations, ideals, and consequences.

### Even Experts Can Be Wrong

Same now argues that "bad neighborhoods, inadequate parents, television, schools, drugs, or unemployment" are not the cause of crime---criminals themselves are. They break the law not because conditions force them to but because they choose to, and they choose to because they consider themselves special and therefore above the law.

### Kinds of Errors

Opinion can be corrupted by any one of four broad kinds of errors.

1. Errors or tendencies to error common among all people by virtue of their being human.
2. Errors or tendencies to error associated with one's individual habits of mind or personal attitudes, beliefs, or theories.
3. Errors that come form human communications and the limitations of language.
4. Errors in the general fashion of an age.

### Informed Versus Uniformed Opinion

All would support the view: that be examining the opinions of informed people before making up our minds, we broaden our perspective, see details we might not see by ourselves, consider facts we would otherwise be unaware of, and lessen our chances of error. 

No one can know everything about everything; there is simply not enough time to learn. Consulting those who have given their special attention to the field of knowledge in question is therefore a mark not of dependence or irresponsibility but of efficiency and good sense.

### Forming Opinions Responsibly

Here are some tips that can help you improve the quality of your opinions:

1. Understand how opinions are formed. When you are not in control, your mental system operates in the <i>uncritical default mode</i> . Here is how that uncritical mode compares with the conscious and more conscientious <i>critical thing mode</i> .

2. Resist the temptation to treat your opinions as facts.
3. Monitor your thoughts to prevent the uncritical default mode from taking charge.

## C6 What Is Evidence

To state an opinion is to tell others what we think about something; to present evidence is to show others that what we think makes sense.

Though it is impossible to be <i>certain</i> why they thought as they did, the fact that they expressed the opinion in the very same words incessantly repeated by someone.

The most important kinds of evidence are <i>personal experience, unpublished report, published report, eyewitness testimony, celebrity testimony, expert opinion, experiment, statistics, survey, formal observation, and research video.</i> 

### Personal Experience

Are the events typical or unique? Are they sufficient in number and kind to support the conclusion?

### Unpublished Report

Where did the story originate? How can I confirm that the version I heard is accurate?

### Published Report

Does the report cite the sources of all important items of information? Does the author have a reputation for careful reporting? Does the publisher or broadcaster have a reputation for reliability? Which statements in the published report constitute evidence, and which should themselves be supported with evidence?

### Eyewitness Testimony

What circumstances surrounding the event, including the eyewitness's state of mind, could have distorted his or her perception? What circumstance since the event---for example, the publication of other accounts of the event---could have affected the eyewitness's recollection?

### Celebrity Testimony

In the case of advertisements or informercials, is the celebrity a paid spokesperson? In the case of talk show comments, does the celebrity offer any support for his or her views---for example, citing research conducted by qualified people? Also, does the host ask for such support? If the discussion consists of little more than a series of assertions expressing the celebrity's unsupported opinion, you would do well to discount it no matter now much you may admire the person.

### Expert Opinion

Does the person have, in addition to credentials in the broad field in question, specific expertise in the particular issue under discussion? This is not always easy to ascertain by those outside the field, but one good indication is that the person does not just state his or her opinion but also supports it with references to current research. Also ask whether the expert was paid. The acceptance of money does not necessarily taint expert opinion, but it may raise questions about the person's objectivity. Finally, ask whether other authorities agree or disagree with the expert's view.

### Experiment

The <i>Laboratory</i> experiment enables researchers to vary the conditions and thereby identify causes and effects more precisely. One disadvantage of the laboratory experiment, however, is its artificiality. The <i>field</i> experiment has the advantage of occurring in a natural setting, but the presence of the researchers can influence the subjects and distort the findings.

For a laboratory experiment, has it been replicated by other researchers? For a field experiment, have other researchers independently confirmed the findings? If replication or confirmation has been unsuccessfully attempted, it is best to postpone your acceptance of the experiment findings.

### Statistics

Who created it? For what purpose was it created? How was it created?

What is the source of the statistics? Is the source reliable? How old are the data? Have any important factors changed since the data were collected?

### Survey

Was the sample truly representative? That is, did all members of the total population surveyed have an equal chance of being selected? Were the questions clear and unambiguous? Were they objectively phrased rather than slanted? In the case of a mailed survey, did a significant number fail to respond? If so, how might non-respondents differ form respondents? Also, do other surveys corroborate the survey's findings?

### Formal Observation

In detached observation the observer does not interact with the individuals being studied.

Is it likely that the presence of the observer distorted the behavior being observed? Was the observation of sufficient duration to permit the conclusions that were drawn? Do the conclusions overgeneralize?

### Research Review

Do the reviewer's conclusions seem reasonable given the research covered in the review? Has the reviewer omitted any relevant research?

One additional question is applicable to all kinds of evidence: Is this evidence <i>relevant</i> to the issue under consideration? If it is not relevant, it deserves no consideration, no matter how excellent it may be in other respects. Here is an actual example of an issue that has been badly confused by the use of irrelevant evidence. 

### Evaluating Evidence

How can you tell when bias is hindering your evaluation of evidence? Look for one or more of these signs:

1. Your approach your evaluation wanting one side to be proved right.
2. You begin your investigation assuming that familiar views will prove correct.
3. You look for evidence that supports the side of the issue you favor and ignore evidence that opposes it.
4. You rate sources by how favorable they are to your thinking rather than by their reliability and the quality of their research.
5. You are nitpickingly critical of evidence for views you oppose and uncritical of evidence for views you favor.
6. When you encounter evidence that opposes your bias, you begin arguing against it, often before you have completed examining it.

The purpose of evaluating evidence is to discover the truth, regardless of whether it is pleasant or unpleasant, and the only way to do son is to evaluate fairly.

### What Constitutes Sufficient Evidence?

1. Evidence if sufficient when it permits a judgment to be made with certainty. Certainty exists when there is no good reason for doubt, no basis for dispute.
2. If certainty is unattainable, evidence is sufficient if one view of the issue has been shown to have the force of probability.
3. In all other cases, the evidence must be considered insufficient.

## C7 What Is Argument

<i>Argument</i> , in this sense, means "the line of reasoning that supports a judgment."

### The parts of an Argument

The basic principles logicians use in evaluating arguments are as follows:

1. The premises are either true of false
2. The reasoning that links the premises to the conclusion is either valid or invalid.
3. Correct premises plus valid reasoning equal a sound argument.
4. Either an incorrect premise or invalid reasoning will render an argument unsound.

Inappropriate attitudes toward ideas and the reasoning process can also lead to errors in argument.

### Evaluating Arguments

The basic approach to evaluating arguments can be stated simply: <i>Decide whether the premises are true of false and whether the reasoning that leads from them to the conclusion is valid.</i> If both criteria are met, the argument is sound. When the argument is clearly and fully stated and you ask the right questions, this approach is relatively to determine the truth or falsity of one or both premises.

### More Difficult Arguments

Unfortunately, not all arguments are clearly and/or fully stated.

<b>When an argument is longer than a paragraph,</b> summarize it before asking and answering your questions.

<b>When you are un certain which statements are the premises and which is the conclusion,</b> ask yourself exactly what idea the person is trying to get you to accept.

<b>When an argument contains more than two premises,</b> ask and answer your questions about each. Don't be daunted if there are many premises---simply take one at a time.

<b>When you are evaluating opposing arguments,</b> neither of which is persuasive, look for a third alternative.

Whatever the length of the passage you are evaluating, be alert for hidden premises.

# The Pitfalls

## C8 The Basic Problem:"Mine Is Better"

"Mine is better" is not an attitude that everyone has about his or her things. Rather, it's a special, higher truth about  their particular situation. Psychologists classify such people as either egocentric or ethnocentric.

### Egocentric People

<i>Egocentric</i> means centered or focused on oneself and interested only in one's own interests, needs, and views.

The art of boosting our own egos by speaking only about what we want to talk about, and not giving a hoot in hell about what the other person wants to talk about.

The world exists for them and is defined by their beliefs and values: What disturbs unimportant. 

### Ethnocentric People

<i>Ethnocentric</i> means excessively centered or focused on one's group. Note the inclusion of the word "excessively." We can feel a sense of identification with our racial-ethnic group, religion, or culture without being ethnocentric. We can also prefer the company of others without being intolerant.

What distinguished ethnocentric individuals from those who feel a normal sense of identification with their group is that ethnocentric people believe (a)that their group is not merely different form other groups but fundamentally and completely superior to them and (b)that the motivations and intentions of other groups are suspect. These beliefs create a bias that blocks critical thinking. Ethnocentric people are eager to challenge the views of other groups but unwilling to question the views of their own group.

Ethnocentric people's prejudice has an additional function. It fills their need for an out-group to blame for real and imagined problems in society.

### Controlling "Mine-Is-Better" Thinking

Our preference for our own thinking can prevent us from identifying flaws in our own ideas, as well as from seeing and building on other people's idea.

Furthermore, our readiness to accept uncritically those who appeal to our preconceived notions leaves us vulnerable to those who would manipulate us for there own purposes.

It is the most basic problem for critical thinkers because, left unchecked, it can distort perception and corrupt judgment. The problem with "MIB" thinking is that it tempts us to forgo evaluation and take it for granted that our idea is best.

##  C9-C12 The Errors in Combination

Errors of Perspective

| <b>The Error</b>           | <b>How to Recognize and Deal with it</b>                     |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Poverty of aspect          | Limiting one's perspective on issues; having tunnel vision. Poverty of aspect sometimes is attribute to intellectual sloth; other times it is a by-product of specialized education and training. To avoid poverty of aspect when evaluating issues, look beyond the familiar, examine all relevant points of view, and understand before judging. |
| Unwarranted  assumptions   | Assumptions are ideas that are taken for granted rather than consciously reasoned out. When what is taken for granted is unjustified by one's experience or by the situation, the assumption is unwarranted. Because assumptions seldom are expressed directly, the only way to identify them is to "read between the lines" for what is unstated but clearly implied. |
| Either/or outlook          | The expectation that the only reasonable view of any issue will be total affirmation or total rejection. This error rules out the possibility that the most reasonable view might lie between the extremes. To avoid this error, consider all possible alternatives. |
| Mindless conformity        | Adopting other's views unthinkingly because we are too lazy or fearful to form out own. To overcome this error, develop the habit or resisting the internal and external pressures and make up your own mind. |
| Absolutism                 | The belief that rules do not admit of exceptions. This belief causes us to demand that the truth be neat and simple, when in reality it is often messy and complex. To avoid this error, accept the truth as you find it rather than requiring that it fit your preconceptions. |
| Relativism                 | The belief that no views is better than any other, that any idea you choose to embrace is automatically correct. To avoid relativism, remind yourself that some ideas, and some standards of conduct, are better than others and that the challenge of critical thinking is to discover the best ones. |
| Bias for or against change | Bias for change assumes that change is always for the best; bias against change assumes that change is always for the worst. To avoid both errors, give any proposal for change a fair hearing and decide, apart from your predisposition, whether the change is actually positive or negative. |



Errors of Procedure

| The Error                           | How to Recognize and Deal with It                            |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Biased consideration of evidence    | One form of this error is seeking evidence that confirms your bias and ignoring evidence that challenges it. Another is interpreting evidence in a way that favors your bias. To avoid this error, begin your investigation by seeking out individuals whose views oppose your bias, then go on to those whose views support it. Also, choose the most reasonable interpretation of the evidence. |
| Double standard                     | Using one set of criteria for judging arguments we agree with and another standard for judging arguments we disagree with. To avoid this error, decide in advance what judgment criteria you will use and apply those criteria consistently, regardless of whether the data in question support your view. |
| Hasty conclusion                    | A premature judgment---that is, a judgment made without sufficient evidence. To avoid drawing a hasty conclusion, identify all possible conclusions before you select any one. Then decide whether you have sufficient evidence to support any of those conclusions and, if so, which conclusions that is. |
| Overgeneralization and stereotyping | Overgeneralization is ascribing to all the members of a group a quality that fits only some members. A stereotype is an overgeneralization that is rigidly maintained. To avoid these errors, resist the urge to force individual people, places, and things into hard categories. And keep in mind that the more limited your experience, the more modest your assertions should be. |
| Oversimplification                  | Oversimplification goes beyond making complex ideas easier to grasp---it twists and distorts the ideas. Instead of informing people, oversimplification misleads them. To avoid this error, refuse to adopt superficial views and make a special effort to understand issues in their complexity. |
| Post hoc fallacy                    | This error is rooted in the idea that when one thing occurs after another, it must be the result of the other, when in reality the sequence may be coincidental. To avoid the post hot fallacy, withhold judgment of a cause-and-effect relationship until you have ruled out other possible causes, including coincidence. |



Errors of Expression

| The Error             | How to Recognize and Deal with It                            |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Contradiction         | To claim that a statement is both true and false at the same time in the same way. To avoid this error, monitor what you say and write. The moment you detect any inconsistency, examine it carefully. Decide whether it is explainable or whether it constitutes a contradiction. If it is a contradiction, revise your statement to make it consistent and reasonable. |
| Arguing in a circle   | Attempting to prove a statement by repeating it in a different form. To avoid this error, check your arguments to be sure you are offering genuine evidence and not merely repeating your claim. |
| Meaningless statement | A statement in which the reasoning presented makes no sense. To avoid this error, check to be sure that the reasons you offer to explain your thoughts and actions really do explain them. |
| Mistaken authority    | Ascribing authority to someone who does not possess it. To avoid this error, check to be sure that all the sources you cite as authorities possess expertise in the particular subject you are writing or speaking about. |
| False analogy         | An analogy is an attempt to explain something relatively unfamiliar by referring to something different but more familiar, saying, in effect, "This is like that." A false analogy claims similarities that do not withstand scrutiny. To avoid this error, test your analogies to be sure that the similarities they claim are real and reasonable and that no important dissimilarities exist. |
| Irrational appeal     | Appeals to emotion, tradition, moderation, authority, common belief, and the tolerance may be either rational or irrational. They are irrational, and therefore unacceptable, when they are unreasonable in the particular situation under discussion and/or when they discourage thought. To avoid this error, make sure your appeals complement thought rather than substitute for it. |



Errors of Reaction

| The Error                    | How to Recognize and Deal with It                            |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Automatic rejection          | The refusal to give criticism of your ideas(or behaviors) a fair hearing. To avoid this error, think of your ideas as possessions that you can keep or discard rather than as extensions of your ego. This will make you less defensive about them. |
| Changing the subject         | Abruptly and deceptively turning a discussion away from the issue under discussion. To avoid this error, face difficult questions head-on rather than trying to avoiding them. |
| Shifting the burden of proof | Demanding that others disprove our assertions. To avoid this error, understand that the burden of supporting any assertion rests with the person who makes it rather than the one who questions it. Accept the responsibility of supporting your assertions. |
| Straw man                    | To commit the error of straw man is to put false words in someone else's mouth and then expose their falsity, conveniently forgetting that the other person never said them. To avoid this error, be scrupulously accurate in quoting or paraphrasing other people's words. |
| Attacking the critic         | Attempting to discredit an idea or argument by disparaging the person who expressed it. To avoid attacking the critic, focus your critical thinking on ideas rather than on the people who express them. |

<i>How can you most effectively use your personal inventory to improve your critical thinking performance? </i> The answer is to apply the following strategy:

1. Answer all the questions in the critical thinking inventory honestly and thoroughly, acknowledging not only the pleasant facts about yourself but also the unpleasant ones.
2. Reflect on your answers, nothing the areas in which you are especially vulnerable. Your goal here is to know your intellectual habits so well that you can predict exactly which thinking problem will arise for you in any particular situation.
3. Whenever you address an issue, anticipate what problems are likely to undermine your thinking at each stage of the thinking process and make a conscious effort to resist their influence.

## C15 Being Observant

Being observant is not merely an interesting quality that enlivens our days. Clear and sound thinking often depends on subtleties that are revealed only by close observation---in other words, by attentive seeing and hearing.

### Observing People

### Observation in Science and Medicine

### The Range of Application

### Becoming More Observant

The way to be observant is to use all five of your senses to keep your mind from wondering aimlessly.

Observant people, on the other hand, have learned how to get outside themselves, to be constantly in touch with what is happening around them.

### Reflecting on Your Observations

Observation will sometimes, by itself, bring value insights. But you can increase the number and quality of your insights by developing the habit of reflecting on your observations.

To be content with little is difficult; to be content with much, impossible. Reflecting on it might lead you to the conclusion that popular culture's emphasis on possessing things---new cars, stylish clothes, and so on---is a false value, that material wealth can never guarantee happiness.

## C16 Selecting an Issue

The term <i>issue</i> , in the context of critical thinking, means any matter about which people tend to disagree; it other words, it is almost synonymous with the word <i>controversy</i> .

### The Basic Rule: less Is More

The only sensible solution to this dilemma is to limit the scope of your analysis. This is the meaning of "less is more" --- aiming for depth rather than breadth.

### How to Limit an Issue

1. List as many aspects of the issue as you can.
2. Decide exactly which aspects you will address.
3. Probe the aspects you are concerned with in one or more clear, carefully focused, questions.

### Narrowing the Issue Further

By limiting the scope of your treatment, you not only ensure a clearer focus and increase the odds of staying within your competency, you also make the task of analysis more manageable.

Even on those rare occasions when you are able to address more than a single sub issue careful identification of all of them will make your inquiry more orderly and purposeful. Finally, limiting your treatment will lessen the chance of your oversimplifying complex matters.

## C17 Conducting Inquiry 

There are two basic kinds of inquiry: inquiry into facts and inquiry into opinions.

### Internet Resources

To evaluate the reliability of your information sources:

1. What is the purpose of the publication or Web site?
2. What is the source's point of view?
3. Does the source engage in personal attacks?
4. Does the source make extravagant assertions?
5. Does the source present evidence for his or her assertions?

### Keeping Focused

Make a special effort to discipline your Internet searches, focusing your attention on relevant material only and resisting the temptation to wander.

### How Much Inquiry Is Enough

Because the aim of inquiry is to produce evidence, it will be helpful to recall the guidelines presented in Chapter 6 for determining when evidence is sufficient.

1. Evidence is sufficient when it permits a judgment to be made with certainty. Certainty exists when there is no good reason for doubt, no basis for dispute.
2. If certainty is unattainable, evidence is sufficient if one view of the issue has been shown to have the force of probability.
3. In all other cases, the evidence must be considered insufficient.

However, although no absolute statement can be made about the amount of inquiry required, you can be reasonably sure your inquiries are complete when you have made a thorough and careful effort to learn the relevant facts and to consult informed opinion in all fields of study that have a direct bearing on the specific issue you are analyzing.

one of the greatest challenges to critical thinking is the temptation to stop inquiring when you find a knowledgeable person who supports your bias.

### Managing Lengthy Material

Responsible authors of journal articles and books do not merely present lists of bald assertions; they support their views with evidence. They also add sufficient explanation to satisfy the demands of clarity and define the path their reasoning has taken. Here is a strategy for doing so:

1. After reading the article or book, go back and identify the key assertions. Look, too, for intensifying words such as moreover, indeed, more(most) important, and more(most) significant.
2. Identify the author's conclusion. The conclusion may appear anywhere, but commonly it appears as follows: in an article---right after the introduction, in the conclusion, or in both places; in a book---in the first or second chapter, in the last chapter, or in both places. Expressions like for these reasons, thus, consequently, so, and therefore signal conclusions.
3. Notice any qualifying words used in the key assertions or the conclusion. They often lead into the second sentence with words like but, however, nevertheless, on the other hand, still, or yet.
4. Note the amount, kinds, and sources of evidence used to support the assertions.
5. Notice the conditions the author includes. Expressions like if, unless, as long as, until, and before can significantly alter the meaning of an assertion.
6. Compose an accurate summary of the article or book from your analysis in steps1-5.

## C18 Forming a Judgment

Critical thinking strategy presented in this chapter:

1. Know your self and remain mindful of the ways in which your habits of mind undermine your treatment of issues.
2. Be observant and reflect on what you see and hear.
3. When you identify an issue, clarify it by listing its aspects and raising probing questions about each.
4. Conduct a thorough inquiry, obtaining all relevant facts and informed opinions.
5. Evaluate your findings, and then form and express your judgment.

### Evaluating Evidence

Evaluating evidence consists of asking and answering appropriate questions. Here is a summary of that discussion.

| The Kind of Evidence                         | The Questions                                                |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Personal experience(yours or other people's) | Are the experiences typical or atypical? Are they sufficient in number and kind to support the conclusion? |
| Unpublished report                           | Where did the story originate? How can I confirm that the version I heard is accurate? |
| Published report                             | Are the sources of important items of information cited? Does the author have a reputation for careful reporting? Does the publisher or broadcaster have a reputation for reliability? Which statements might a thoughtful person challenge? How well does the author answer the challenges? |
| Eyewitness testimony                         | What circumstance could have distorted the eyewitness's perception? What circumstances since the event could have affected his or her recollection? |
| Celebrity testimony                          | For advertisements or infomercials, is the celebrity a paid spokesperson? For talk show comments, does the celebrity offer any support for his or her views---for example, citing research conducted by more qualified people? Also, does the host ask for such support? |
| Expert opinion                               | Does the person have specific expertise in the particular issue under discussion? Does the expert support his or her view with references  to current research? Do other authorities agree or disagree with the expert's view? |
| Experiment                                   | For a laboratory experiment, has it been replicated by other researchers? For a field experiment, have other researchers independently confirmed the findings? |
| Statistics Survey                            | Is the source of the statistics reliable? Was the sample truly representative---that is, did all members of the total population surveyed have an equal chance of being selected? Were the questions clear, unambiguous, and objectively phrased? For a mailed survey, did a significant number fail to respond? Also, do other surveys corroborate the survey's findings? |
| Formal observation                           | Could the observer's presence have distorted what occurred? Was the observation of sufficient duration to permit the conclusions that were drawn? Do the conclusions overgeneralize? |
| Research review                              | Do the reviewer's conclusions seem reasonable given the research covered in the review? Has the reviewer omitted any relevant research? |

### Evaluating Your Sources' Arguments

First, it prevents you form judging hastily, on the basis of first impressions. Second, it allows you to evaluate each part of the argument individually(rather than settling for an overall evaluation) and thus to identify both strengths and weaknesses. Finally, taking the time to ask appropriate questions often provides a structure around which to arrange your thoughts.

### Making Important Distinctions

Here are six kinds of distinctions that frequently are necessary to avoid faulty evaluations:

1. Between the person and the idea.
2. Between what is said and how it is said.
3. Between why people think as they do and whether what they think is correct. The soundness of an idea doesn't depend on the motivations of those who support it. It depends on how well the idea fits the realities of the situation.
4. Between the individual and the group or class.
5. Between matters of preference and matters of judgment.
6. Between familiarity and correctness. To respond less guardedly to the familiar than to the unfamiliar is natural.

### Expressing Judgments

1. Strive for a balanced view.
2. Deal with probability.
3. Make your subject appropriately specific.
4. Make your predicate exact.
5. Include all appropriate qualifications.
6. Avoid exaggeration.

## Persuading Others

<i>Persuasion</i> means presenting your view so effectively that people who have no position on the issue will be inclined to agree with you and those who disagree with you will be motivated to reconsider their own view.

Guidelines for Persuasion:

1. Respect your audience
2. Understand your audience's viewpoint
3. Begin form a position you have in common with your readers
4. Take a positive approach
5. Understate your argument whenever possible
6. Concede where the opposing side has a point
7. Don't ignore any relevant facts. The purpose of argument is not to defeat others but, through the exchange of views, to discover the truth in all its complexity.
8. Don't overwhelm your readers with arguments
9. Focus on the argument best calculated to persuade your audience
10. Never use an argument you do not believe is sound or relevant
11. Allow time for your view to gain acceptance
